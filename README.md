## Background 

résuméAnywhere was inspired by a common problem many people face at some point in their lives – which is how to create an effective résumé. This is especially so for freshmen or those with less job application experience, crafting a résumé can be a stressful task that ends up taking more time and effort than necessary. We believe that résuméAnywhere helps address this problem.  

## About Us 

We are both Y1 students studying Computer Science in NUS. After taking career-focused modules CFG1002 and STR1000, we wanted to consolidate the information taught into a convenient platform for us to generate effective resumes based on the tips that were taught to us. 

 

## Set Up 

In the project directory, you can run: 

```bash 

npm start
yarn start
expo start 

``` 

Runs the app in the development mode. 
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. 

The page will reload if you make edits. 
You will also see any lint errors in the console. 

```bash 

npm test
yarn test
expo test 

``` 

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. 
See the section about running tests for more information. 

```bash 
npm run build
yarn run build
expo run build

Builds the app for production to the build folder. 
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
