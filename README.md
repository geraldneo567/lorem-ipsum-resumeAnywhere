## Background 

résuméAnywhere was inspired by a common problem many people face at some point in their lives – which is how to create an effective résumé. This is especially so for freshmen or those with less job application experience, crafting a résumé can be a stressful task that ends up taking more time and effort than necessary. We believe that résuméAnywhere helps address this problem.  

## About Us 

We are both Y1 students studying Computer Science in NUS. After taking career-focused modules CFG1002 and STR1000, we wanted to consolidate the information taught into a convenient platform for us to generate effective resumes based on the tips that were taught to us.
